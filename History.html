                            From the 1940s to the present, discover how cybercrime and cybersecurity have developed to become what we know today

                            <br>Many species evolve in parallel, each seeking a competitive edge over the other. As cybersecurity
                            and technology have evolved, so have criminals and ‘bad actors’ who seek to exploit weaknesses
                            in the system for personal gain – or just to prove a point.

                            <br>This arms race has been going on since the 1950s, and this article explains the evolution of
                            cyberattacks and security solutions.

                            1940s: The time before crime For nearly two decades after the creation of the world’s first digital computer in 1943, carrying
                            out cyberattacks was tricky. Access to the giant electronic machines was limited to small numbers
                            of people and they weren’t networked – only a few people knew how to work them so the threat
                            was almost non-existent. Interestingly, the theory underlying computer viruses was first made
                            public in 1949 when computer pioneer John von Neumann speculated that computer programs could
                            reproduce.

                        <h3> 1950s: The phone phreaks</h3>
                        <p>

                            The technological and subcultural roots of hacking are as much related to early telephones as they are to computers. In the
                            late 1950s, ‘phone phreaking’ emerged. The term captures several methods that ‘phreaks’ – people
                            with a particular interest in the workings of phones – used to hijack the protocols that allowed
                            telecoms engineers to work on the network remotely to make free calls and avoid long-distance
                            tolls. Sadly for the phone companies, there was no way of stopping the phreaks, although the
                            practice eventually died out in the 1980s. The phreaks had become a community, even issuing newsletters,
                            and included technological trailblazers like Apple’s founders Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs. The
                            mold was set for digital technology.

                        <h3>1960s: All quiet on the Western Front</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first-ever reference to malicious hacking was in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s student newspaper. Even
                            by the mid-1960s, most computers were huge mainframes, locked away in secure temperature-controlled
                            rooms. These machines were very costly, so access – even to programmers – remained limited. However,
                            there were early forays into hacking by some of those with access, often students. At this stage,
                            the attacks had no commercial or geopolitical benefits. Most hackers were curious mischief-makers
                            or those who sought to improve existing systems by making them work more quickly or efficiently.

                        <p>
                            The 2010s saw many high-profile breaches and attacks starting to impact the national security of countries and cost businesses
                            millions. 2012: Saudi hacker 0XOMAR publishes the details of more than 400,000 credit cards online
                            2013: Former CIA employee for the US Government Edward Snowden copied and leaked classified information
                            from the National Security Agency (NSA) 2013-2014: Malicious hackers broke into Yahoo, compromising
                            the accounts and personal information of its 3 billion users.  </p>

                        <h3>2020s: Shaping the Future</h3>
                        <p>
                            With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing countless people out of the office and at the mercy of cybercriminals, it is unsurprising
                            that there were several high-profile security breaches across a variety of industries throughout
                            2020. Perhaps the most infamous and high-profile hack of 2020, the successful supply chain exploit
                            of SolarWinds has caused reverberations throughout the cyber world, the full ramifications of
                            which are still largely unknown. With clients including the US Department of Defense and the
                            Microsoft corporation, cybercriminals were able to corrupt one of the servers which provided
                            access to patches and updates for SolarWinds Orion tools. As such, it may take years to fully
                            understand the scope and damage wrought by going undetected for so long. Other notable hacks
                            from 2020 include several celebrity Twitter accounts being hacked to scam Bitcoin from unsuspecting
                            fan communities. </p>
